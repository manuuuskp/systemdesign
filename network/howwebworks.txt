What is networking ?
Basically how does the communication between two systems happen is where the networking comes into picture.

how web works ?
Whenever the user search a website, the call will be sent to the ISP which then transfers the call to the DNS(Domain Name Server),
Where the server returns the IP address of the domain which we searched.

[how does it fetches the IP address ?

For example:
www.google.com

three level of matching happens.

first level is with .com or .in or .org or .store etc

second level is with domain name - google, facebook, unusuals, amazon etc

third level is with www or document etc]

once the IP address is returned, then the client will sent that to the ISP which then looks for the actual server which has this IP address,
then the server is accessed and then the server returns the HTML, CSS and JS as the response which then will be loaded by the Browser(client)

TYPES OF NETWORKING PROTOCOLS:
1.Http - creates a TCP handshake and then sends the data in packets. data will not be lost at any cost.
2.Http3/QUIC - just sends the data and receives the data for a quick request and response. but there is a chance that the data might be lost.
3.Https - adds the security layer (TLS and SSL) - so that the data sent and received will be encrypted and cannot be taken.
4.TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) - firstly the client sends the handshake invite with the ACK number. The server then responds with its own ACK number and client's ACK number plus 1.
The client that sends the confirmation of the handshake sent by server with server sent ACK number plus 1.
5.UDP(User DataGram Protocol) - unlike TCP, this is a connectionless communication protocol over the network. It sends the data without any estabilishing any initial connection.
This is used for faster sending and receiving the data.
6.SMTL(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) - used to send and receive the mail.
7.FTP(File Transfer Protocol) - used to send and receive the files.
